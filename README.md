# Django-based-restful-api

Here is the REST api that when used can be used to book a movie ticket.
This project is solely based upon python and I have used python based framework Django to deploy my api. This api can be furthur used to book tickets for movies. Also I have used PostgreSQL as a database for the tables and schemas.

# Django Based Travel Web App

I have also built a demo web app based upon traveling where you can use book tickets for different traveling destinations. This project uses database POSTGRESQL to render different images of destinations
